The hydrophone is amplified by 62 dB.
Laser pulse width: 10 ns
laser repetition rate: 150 kHz
laser power: 40 mW
laser energy applied on sample: 0.2Î¼J
wavenumber: 2960 cm-1
raw data can be read by the MATLAB code in the PA folder named by PA_data_reader
sampling rate: 1 GHz
hydrophone calibration curve is attached in the PA folder
the PA waveform in frequency domain can be obtained by doing the Fourier transform of the PA waveform in time domain
